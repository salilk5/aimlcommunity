Gaussian Distribution

The Normal distribution or the Gaussian distribution is a probability function that describes how values of a variable
are distributed. It is a symmetric distribution where most of the data points are around the central peak and values away from the mean taper off equally in both the directions

Two main parameters define the Gaussian distribution

A)Mean

It is the central tendency of the distribution.It defines the location of the peak for the normal distribution
Most values are concentrated around the mean.


B)Standard Deviation

It is a measure of variability and defines the width of the distribution. It determines how far away from the mean
the values tend to fall. It represents the average distance between observation and image.

By formula : It is the square root of the variance


Variance is defined as : Average of the squared differences from the Mean

1)Work out the Mean:  Simple average of the numbers

2)For each number : Subtract the Mean and square the result

3)Work out the average of the squared differences






Binomial Distribution

A binomial distribution can be described as the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment that is repeated multiple times. It is a type of distribution that has two possible outcomes (“Bi” means two,or twice). 


The following criteria must be met

The number of observations or trials is fixed

Each trial is independent.

The probability of success (tails, heads, fail or pass) is the same from one trial to another.
